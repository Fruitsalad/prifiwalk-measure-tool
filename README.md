This is a CLI program for a thesis project about artificial filesystem aging.
This program serves to derive some additional statistics from databases
generated by PriFiwalk ([link](https://github.com/guydols/PriFiwalk)).
This was developed for use with the WildFrag database, which is unfortunately
not publicly available.

A lot of the code was written before I figured out that data processing
is easier in something like Excel or Calc, so a lot of it actually goes unused.
I can't quite bring myself to delete all of the unused code.

Run with `python3 ./measure_tool -h`.
